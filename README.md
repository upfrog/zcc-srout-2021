This was an interview project I did while applying for an internship with Zendesk. Unfortunately, it is incomplete, but it is another example of my code, and shows some work with APIs. 

The goal of the program is to connect to the Zendesk customer service ticket API, retrieve some tickets, and print them, along with providing several options to interact with the tickets.

To install, download the main file. Ensure that you have python and the requests package installed. Use requires access to a Zendesk account, and that the token is changed to one that is active for your account.
